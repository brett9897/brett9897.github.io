Hi! My name is Brett. I have been a software engineer for about a decade now. 

I started out as a fullstack developer using C# mainly. At that job I was transitioned to being a UI Angular developer. After about a year of that they moved all UI developers back to fullstack. I then moved on to another company where we were transitioning off of the .NET MVC stack and onto stack with Java for the backend API and services and React as the front end. I then started building a few microservices using node.js to show that it was actually cheaper to run a bunch of nano node servers on AWS than it was to provision a bigger server to run Tomcat with Java.

Having that broad background I moved on to being the lead developer on a new project.  That new project was built with nodejs for all of the backend (API, services, etc.) and React for the frontend. With my background for the backend being mainly C# and Java I found myself building an unwieldly backend with dependency injections and a bunch of objects that didn't need to exist. I have since started learning FP techniques and slowly unrolling all that OOP Javascript that wasn't working at all.

I hope you enjoy my musings and maybe learn something from it as well.
