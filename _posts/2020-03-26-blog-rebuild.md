I was getting really frustrated with the lack of support for using coding snippets in blogger so I recently rebuilt my blog.  I am now using jekyll to build it.  I thought about building my own, but that seems to be something I never finish and I wanted to keep blogging.

I know nothing looks good right now but I promise you I will be cleaning it up and making it look better
