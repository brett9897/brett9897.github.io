It took me quite a bit of time to figure out how to do a sticky footer while using both Twitter Bootstrap and EmberJS. &nbsp;After applying the solution provided by&nbsp;<a href="http://martinbean.co.uk/" target="_blank">Martin Bean</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://ryanfait.com/sticky-footer/" target="_blank">Ryan Fait</a>&nbsp;found at&nbsp;<a href="http://getbootstrap.com/2.3.2/examples/sticky-footer-navbar.html" target="_blank">http://getbootstrap.com/2.3.2/examples/sticky-footer-navbar.html</a>, I found that my footer wasn't sticky at all. &nbsp;It was still jumping up to the top of the screen.<br /><a name='more'></a>I found out by inspecting the generated code in the Chrome developer tools that EmberJS also adds a div to the body of the document. &nbsp;In order to get it all to work I had to add an extra CSS style. &nbsp;The style I added was:<br /><br /><pre class="brush: css;" name="code">.ember-view {<br />  height: 100%;<br />}<br /></pre><br />Hopefully this helps someone else out that had the same problem.<br /><br />The code can be seen in use at&nbsp;<strike><a href="http://omegayeast.com/" target="_blank">http://OmegaYeast.com</a>.</strike>&nbsp; I currently don't have a live page using this code, but trust me that it works.
