I know. I know. This site doesn't look all that great. This is just temporary and I will be building a new one using 
[Domain Modeling Made Functional]("https://pragprog.com/book/swdddf/domain-modeling-made-functional") techniques. Hopefully that gives me more things to blog about and I can clean up the design into multiple organized topics.<br /><br />I hope you enjoy the new content!

#### Update
I have updated the blog but I ended up using Jekyll to build it. I mainly went with Jekyll because it was easy and you could host it through github so there was no cost. I might later try to build my own Jekyll like system, but at this point it isn't worth it.
