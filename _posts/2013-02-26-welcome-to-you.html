&nbsp;I would like to welcome everyone to my new blog. &nbsp;I will try to make a daily update about a problem I had with code and my solution to the problem. &nbsp;My hope is that I will be able to help those that have a similar problem and couldn't find a solution elsewhere. &nbsp;My inspiration is that many times searching the interwebs does not always satisfactorily answer some of my technical questions and thus I have to combine together many tidbits gleaned from different sources plus use a little of my own ingenuity to come up with a proper solution.<br /><br />To Help others not reinvent the wheel, I will post my final solutions to solve those problems so that hopefully one day when you are searching for something similar my post will help you.<br /><br />On a side note, I might also throw in a few OT posts when I feel I really need to say something not related to code and IT.<br /><br />That is all. Good day, sir.<br /><br />I said good day!
