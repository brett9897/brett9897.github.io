I haven't really been keeping up with my blogging and that is because I haven't been working on very many side projects lately. &nbsp;With all my coding being work related, I can't really show much from it for two reasons.<br /><a name='more'></a><br /><br /><ol><li>The subject matter of what I am learning to do is not really applicable to this audience as it is all about strange functionality within the Google AdWords API.</li><li>I can't show any examples that would reveal the architecture that we are working with here without getting permission and I am just too lazy to do that.</li></ol><div>I have decided that I will begin investing more time working on side projects. Working on side projects will cause me to run into more things that I don't know to do and will give me more things to write about.</div><div><br /></div><div>The first project will be to stop using a blogging platform and build my own. &nbsp;I mean what self-respecting web developer doesn't build the platform they use by themselves? &nbsp;I think a blog is a great first simple step that will get me past a lot of the gotchas I might run into. &nbsp;So along the way I will fill others in on what they need to do in order to get it to work when they try to build something.</div><div><br /></div><div>Wish me luck and I hope I eventually release this thing.</div>
